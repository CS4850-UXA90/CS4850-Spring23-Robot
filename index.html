        # VR Movement with a UXA-90 Robot

        ## Members
        George L. | Kazhan S. | Vincent G. | Ian B.

        ## Goal
        This project was designed by members of the SP-1 Team for Spring 2023 CS4850-02 Senior Project class. We utilized Unity to issue API commands to a Raspberry Pi while on a local network to the UXA-90 robot. The goal of this application is to enable a user to see and interact with the world through the robot. Through this project we hope that successive teams and other developers can use what we've done for their next project.

        ### Base Movement
        Connects the UXA-90 robot and Raspberry Pi to the Meta Quest 2. VR controller inputs are sent to the Raspberry Pi and API calls are made to control the robot's basic motion.

        Movement: 
        + Walk left, right, or forward
        + Rotate left or right
        + Crouch (work in progress)
        + Dance (work in progress)

        ### Vision
        *** Soon to be added ***

        ### Head Tracking
        *** Soon to be added ***

        ### Hand Tracking
        *** Soon to be added ***
